Brackeys GameJam 2021.1
Prototype Idea I created for the Brackeys GameJam.
It is a game inspired by Rampage where two giant apes in multiplayer,
climb a giant skyscraper.
Unfortunately I did not come that far and can only be run in the editor, but I learned a bit about unreal networking and c++ programming. The two apes can move up and down and manipulate the world in lan multiplayer.
